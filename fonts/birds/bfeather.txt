This is a dingbat font with over 45 silhouettes of various birds - hawks, parrots, ducks, vultres, gulls, doves and so forth.

Silhouettes have mirrored counterparts between the upper and lower cases. Use of a character map program, such as Windows' Character Map, will be very helpful in exploring and using this font.
